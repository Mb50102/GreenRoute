# GreenRoute
Green routes are created in such a way that when calculating the route, preference is given to roads on which there are currently a lower number of motor vehicles.
The user can define in the mobile application how much environmentally friendly the route will be. In settings the variable radius can be adjusted to determine how far we will move away from roads that have an increased number of cars. The traffic congestion factor can also be customized in the settings. The traffic congestion factor determines those parts of the roads that will be avoided. Among other things, in the application, there is a possibility to graphically display to the user the congested parts of the roads. Traffic congestion data is in real-time retrieved from the Here server.
